## Functionality

Regardless of the edition that you select, all key development features will be available to you:
1. Creating an RPA-project - a set of automation scenarios.
2. Selecting a convenient representation for the scenario: sequence, workflow or code.
3. Over 500 built-in elements for the work with 3rd party applications (desktop, web), databases, file system and other objects.
4. Additional libraries (dependencies) and the ability to create your own.
5. Checking the quality of an RPA scenario using:
   * automatic verification of code syntax;
   * an analyzer that checks scenario quality using an internal set of rules.
6. Step-by-step scenario debugging. Flexible setup of debugger and logging, use of breakpoints and status panels for variables.
7. Importing projects from other RPA platforms, for example, UiPath.
8. Creating project templates to facilitate development of new scenarios.
9. Selecting UI theme and language.

## How to get 

**Studio Community** can be requested at the [official Primo RPA platform website](https://primo-rpa.ru/). Although Studio itself is free of charge, projects can be launched only within it - Primo Robot application requires a separate license.

**Studio Enterprise** [distribution package can be found here](https://disk.primo-rpa.ru/index.php/s/primo?path=%2FRelease%2FStudio). During installation Studio will ask for a license: it is necessary to create a license request and send it to the vendor's email. You can find more information about it, as well as about license types, in the section [Launching Studio Enterprise](https://docs.primo-rpa.ru/primo-rpa/primo-studio/enterprise).
