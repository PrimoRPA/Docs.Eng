# Fine-tuning

## Setting up panels

Visual representation of Studio panels can be fine-tuned. Panel states are saved if the work with Studio is finished correctly. To revert the panels to their default states, click “Panels reset” in the View menu, or close Studio and delete the Layouts folder from the Studio installation folder.

To hide a panel, click on the “x” in the top right corner of the panel:

To show the panel again, press the corresponding button in the View menu.

Automatic expanding and collapsing of a panel is controlled by the pin button next to the “x” button:

Panel location on the screen can be changed by grabbing the panel header and dragging it to the desired location. 

To undock a panel and use it as a separate window, grab the panel header and drag it outside of the Studio window.

The same actions are available through the panel context menu - to access it, right-click on the panel header.

To group panels together, grab the panel header and drag it over another panel - the panels will be displayed as tabs. 

You can set up buttons on the action bar and sections of the main menu by clicking on the options button in the toolbar.

Advanced settings can be accessed by selecting the “Customize…” option.

It will open the “Customization” window that contains settings for toolbars, commands and options. You can select the buttons to be displayed on the action bar, specify the commands that will be performed by the buttons, create new buttons for added convenience, as well as set up icons and tooltips.
