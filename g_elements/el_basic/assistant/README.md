1. Hint text. May contain text, HTML or web page URL;
2. Hint window;
3. Hint window border;
4. Highlight rectangle.

**Window coordinates** can be set in absolute X and Y coordinates (highlight rectangle invisible) or relative to a Web or Desktop element (highlight rectangle visible).

**Window size** as well as **Hint window position** (TOP, BOTTOM, TOP\_LEFT, etc.) relative to the element or coordinates are specified in the element properties. 

**Hint text** - if you choose either HTML or page URL, the hint window will show page content. For plain text, editable properties include font family, font size, font color, bold and italic.

Background, border and rectangle color can also be edited in the properties panel.

In addition, you can make the screen fade when you show a hint. This is done using the **Fade** option in the element properties.
